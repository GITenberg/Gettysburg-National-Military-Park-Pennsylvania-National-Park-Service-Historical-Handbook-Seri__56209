<p>On the gently rolling farm lands surrounding the little town
of Gettysburg, Pa., was fought one of the great decisive battles
of American history. For 3 days, from July 1 to 3, 1863, a gigantic
struggle between 75,000 Confederates and 88,000 Union troops raged
about the town and left 51,000 casualties in its wake. Heroic deeds were
numerous on both sides, climaxed by the famed Confederate assault on
July 3 which has become known throughout the world as Pickett&rsquo;s
Charge. The Union victory gained on these fields ended the last Confederate
invasion of the North and marked the beginning of a gradual
decline in Southern military power.</p>
<p>Here also, a few months after the battle, Abraham Lincoln delivered
his classic Gettysburg Address at the dedication of the national cemetery
set apart as a burial ground for the soldiers who died in the conflict.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>The Situation, Spring 1863</i></span></h2>
<p>The situation in which the Confederacy found itself in the late spring
of 1863 called for decisive action. The Union and Confederate armies
had faced each other on the Rappahannock River, near Fredericksburg,
Va., for 6 months. The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded
by Gen. R. E. Lee, had defeated the Union forces at Fredericksburg
in December 1862 and again at Chancellorsville in May 1863, but
the nature of the ground gave Lee little opportunity to follow up his
advantage. When he began moving his army westward, on June 3, he
hoped, at least, to draw his opponent away from the river to a more
advantageous battleground. At most, he might carry the war into northern
territory, where supplies could be taken from the enemy and a
victory could be fully exploited. Even a fairly narrow margin of victory
might enable Lee to capture one or more key cities and perhaps increase
northern demands for a negotiated peace.</p>

<p>Confederate strategists had considered sending aid from Lee&rsquo;s army to
Vicksburg, which Grant was then besieging, or dispatching help to
General Bragg for his campaign against Rosecrans in Tennessee. They
concluded, however, that Vicksburg could hold out until climatic conditions
would force Grant to withdraw, and they reasoned that the eastern
campaign was more important than that of Tennessee.</p>
<p>Both Union and Confederate governments had bitter opponents at
home. Southern generals, reading in Northern newspapers the clamors
for peace, had reason to believe that their foe&rsquo;s morale was fast weakening.
They felt that the Army of Northern Virginia would continue to
demonstrate its superiority over the Union Army of the Potomac and
that the relief from constant campaigning on their own soil would have
a happy effect on Southern spirit. Events were to prove, however, that
the chief result of the intense alarm created by the invasion was to rally
the populace to better support of the Union government.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>The Plan of Campaign</i></span></h2>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s plan of campaign was undoubtedly similar to that of his invasion
which ended in the battle of Antietam in September 1862. He then
called attention to the need of destroying the bridge over the Susquehanna
River at Harrisburg and of disabling the Pennsylvania Railroad
in order to sever communication with the west. &ldquo;After that,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;I can turn my attention to Philadelphia, Baltimore, or Washington as
may seem best for our interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee had suffered an irreparable loss at Chancellorsville when &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;
Jackson was mortally wounded. Now reorganized into three
infantry corps under Longstreet, A. P. Hill, and R. S. Ewell, and a cavalry
division under J. E. B. Stuart, a changed Army of Northern Virginia
faced the great test that lay ahead. &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson, the right hand
of Lee, and in the words of the latter &ldquo;the finest executive officer the sun
ever shone on,&rdquo; was no longer present to lead his corps in battle.</p>
<p>The long lines of gray started moving on June 3 from Fredericksburg,
Va., first northwestward across the Blue Ridge, then northward in the
Shenandoah Valley. On June 9, one of the greatest cavalry engagements
of the war occurred at Brandy Station. Union horsemen, for the first
time, held Stuart&rsquo;s men on even terms. The Confederates then continued
their march northward, with the right flank constantly protected by
Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry, which occupied the passes of the Blue Ridge. Stuart was
ordered to hold these mountain gaps until the advance into Pennsylvania
had drawn the Union Army north of the Potomac. On June 28,
Hill and Longstreet reached Chambersburg, 16 miles north of the Pennsylvania
boundary. Rodes&rsquo; division of Ewell&rsquo;s corps reached Carlisle on
June 27. Early&rsquo;s command of 8,000 men had passed through Gettysburg
on June 26 and on the 28th had reached York. Early planned to take
possession of the bridge over the Susquehanna at Columbia, and to move
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
on Harrisburg from the east. Lee&rsquo;s converging movement on Harrisburg
seemed to be on the eve of success.</p>
<p>An unforeseen shift of events between June 25 and 28, however,
threatened to deprive Lee of every advantage he had thus far gained in
his daring march up the Shenandoah and Cumberland Valleys. The
cavalry engagement between Stuart and Pleasonton at Brandy Station
convinced Gen. Joseph Hooker, then in command of the Union Army,
that the Confederate Army was moving northward. President Lincoln
and General in Chief Halleck, informed of this movement, ordered
Hooker to proceed northward and to keep his command between the
Confederate Army and Washington. When he was refused permission
to abandon Harpers Ferry, and to add the garrison of 10,000 men to his
army, Hooker asked to be relieved of command. Gen. George G. Meade
received orders to assume command of the army at Frederick, Md., on
June 28, and he at once continued the march northward.</p>
<p>General Stuart, in command of the Confederate cavalry, had obtained
conditional approval from Lee to operate against the rear of the Union
Army as it marched northward and then to join Lee north of the Potomac.
As he passed between Hooker&rsquo;s army and Washington, the unexpected
speed of the Union Army forced Stuart into detours and delays, so that
on June 28 he was in eastern Maryland, wholly out of touch with the
Confederate force. The eyes and ears of Lee were thus closed at a time
when their efficient functioning was badly needed.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>In this state of affairs, a Confederate agent reported to Lee at Chambersburg,
Pa., on the night of June 28, that the Union forces had crossed
the Potomac and were in the vicinity of Frederick. With the entire
Union Army close at hand and with many miles between him and his
base, Lee decided to abandon his original plan and to concentrate for
battle. He moved his army at once across the mountains to Cashtown,
8 miles from Gettysburg. Here, in Cashtown Pass, he planned to establish
his battle position. Rodes, then at Carlisle, and Early, at York, were
at once ordered to this point.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>The First Day</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c4">THE TWO ARMIES CONVERGE ON GETTYSBURG.</h3>
<p>The men of Heth&rsquo;s
division, leading the Confederate advance across the mountain, reached
Cashtown on June 29. Pettigrew&rsquo;s brigade was sent on to Gettysburg the
following day to obtain supplies, but upon reaching the ridge a mile
west of the town, they observed Union cavalry scouts posted along the
roads. Not having orders to bring on an engagement, Pettigrew withdrew
to Cashtown.</p>

<p>In the intervening 2 days since he had assumed command of the Union
forces, General Meade had moved his troops northward and instructed
his engineers to survey a defensive battle position at Pipe Creek, near
Taneytown, in northern Maryland. Buford&rsquo;s cavalry, which had effectively
shadowed Lee&rsquo;s advance from the mountaintops of the Blue Ridge
was ordered to make a reconnaissance in the Gettysburg area. It was
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
these troops that Pettigrew&rsquo;s men saw posted on the roads leading into
the town. Neither Lee nor Meade yet foresaw Gettysburg as a field of
battle. Each expected to take a strong defensive position and force his
adversary to attack.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Lt. Gen. Ambrose P. Hill.</i> (Courtesy National
Archives.)</p>
</div>
<p>A. P. Hill, in the absence of Lee, who was still beyond the mountains,
now took the initiative. At daybreak of July 1, he ordered the brigades
of Archer and Davis, of Heth&rsquo;s division, to advance along the Chambersburg
Road to Gettysburg for the purpose of testing the strength of the
Union forces. As these troops reached Marsh Creek, 4 miles from Gettysburg,
they were fired upon by Union cavalry pickets who hurriedly
retired to inform their commander of the enemy&rsquo;s approach. In the
meantime, Buford&rsquo;s division of cavalry had moved from their camp just
southwest of Gettysburg to McPherson Ridge, a mile west of the town.
Buford prepared to hold out against heavy odds until aid arrived. Thus,
subordinate field commanders had chosen the ground for battle.</p>
<p>It was 8 a.&nbsp;m., July 1, when the two brigades of Archer and Davis, the
former to the right and the latter to the left of the Chambersburg Road,
deployed on Herr Ridge. Supported by Pegram&rsquo;s artillery, they charged
down the long slope and across Willoughby Run against Buford&rsquo;s men.
The Union troopers had recently received an issue of Spencer repeating
carbines. Dismounted, and fighting as infantrymen, they held their
ground against the spirited attacks of Heth&rsquo;s superior numbers. At 10
o&rsquo;clock timely aid arrived as troops from Gen. John F. Reynolds&rsquo; First
Infantry corps began streaming over Seminary Ridge from the south and
relieved Buford&rsquo;s exhausted fighters. Calef&rsquo;s battery, one of whose guns
had fired the first shot at Gettysburg, was replaced by Hall&rsquo;s Maine
artillery. But, in a few moments, Union joy at receiving aid was offset
by tragedy. Reynolds, close to the front lines, was killed instantly by a
sharpshooter&rsquo;s bullet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>The struggle increased in scope as more forces reached the field. When
Archer&rsquo;s Confederates renewed the attack across Willoughby Run,
Union troops of Meredith&rsquo;s Iron Brigade, arriving opportunely, struck
the flank of the Confederates and captured the greater part of the force,
including General Archer. Relieved from the threat south of the Chambersburg
Pike, the 14th Brooklyn and 7th Wisconsin regiments shifted
to the north of the Pike where the Confederates had captured a part of
Cutler&rsquo;s troops in the railroad cut. With renewed effort, these troops,
joined by Dawes&rsquo; 6th Wisconsin, drove the Confederates steadily back,
capturing two Mississippi regiments in the defile. The Confederates then
withdrew beyond striking distance. There was a lull in the fighting
during the noon hour. The first encounter had given Union men confidence.
They had held their ground against superior numbers and had
captured Archer, a brigadier general, the first Confederate general officer
taken since Lee assumed command.</p>

<h3 id="c5">THE BATTLE OF OAK RIDGE.</h3>
<p>While the initial test of strength was being
determined west of Gettysburg by advance units, the main bulk of the
two armies was pounding over the roads from the north and south, converging
upon the ground chosen by Buford. Rodes&rsquo; Confederates, hurrying
southward from Carlisle to meet Lee at Cashtown, received orders
at Biglerville to march to Gettysburg. Early, returning from York with
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Cashtown as his objective, learned at Heidlersburg of the action at
Gettysburg and was ordered to approach by way of the Harrisburg Road.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="pcap"><i>Chambersburg Pike, looking westward from the Federal position
toward Herr Ridge, where the Confederate attack began.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Employing the wooded ridge as a screen from Union cavalry north of
Gettysburg, Rodes brought his guns into position on Oak Ridge about
1 o&rsquo;clock and opened fire on the flank of Gen. Abner Doubleday,
Reynolds&rsquo; successor, on McPherson Ridge. The Union commander
shifted his lines northeastward to Oak Ridge and the Mummasburg
Road to meet the new attack. Rodes&rsquo; Confederates struck the Union
positions at the stone wall on the ridge, but the attack was not well
coordinated and resulted in failure. Iverson&rsquo;s brigade was nearly annihilated
as it made a left wheel to strike from the west. In the meantime,
more Union troops had arrived on the field by way of the Taneytown
Road. Two divisions of Howard&rsquo;s Eleventh corps were now taking position
in the plain north of the town, intending to make contact with
Doubleday&rsquo;s troops on Oak Ridge.</p>
<p>Doles&rsquo; Confederate brigade charged across the plain and was able to
force Howard&rsquo;s troops back temporarily, but it was the opportune approach
of Early&rsquo;s division from the northeast on the Harrisburg Road
which rendered the Union position north of Gettysburg indefensible.
Arriving in the early afternoon as the Union men were establishing their
position, Early struck with tremendous force, first with his artillery and
then with his infantry, against General Barlow. Soon he had shattered
the entire Union force. The remnants broke and turned southward
through Gettysburg in the direction of Cemetery Hill. In this headlong
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
and disorganized flight General Schimmelfenning was lost from his
command, and, finding refuge in a shed, he lay 2 days concealed within
the Confederate lines. In the path of Early&rsquo;s onslaught lay the youthful
Brigadier Barlow severely wounded, and the gallant Lieut. Bayard
Wilkeson, whose battery had long stood against overwhelming odds,
mortally wounded.</p>

</div>
<p>The Union men on Oak Ridge, faced with the danger that Doles
would cut off their line of retreat, gave way and retired through Gettysburg
to Cemetery Hill. The withdrawal of the Union troops from the
north and northwest left the Union position on McPherson Ridge
untenable. Early in the afternoon, when Rodes opened fire from Oak
Hill, Heth had renewed his thrust along the Chambersburg Pike. His
troops were soon relieved and Pender&rsquo;s division, striking north and south
of the road, broke the Union line. The Union troops first withdrew to
Seminary Ridge, then across the fields to Cemetery Hill. Here was advantageous
ground which had been selected as a rallying point if the
men were forced to relinquish the ground west and north of the town.
Thus, by 5 o&rsquo;clock, the remnants of the Union forces (some 6,000 out
of the 18,000 engaged in the first day&rsquo;s struggle) were on the hills south
of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Ewell was now in possession of the town, and he extended his line
from the streets eastward to Rock Creek. Studiously observing the hills
in his front, he came within range of a Union sharpshooter, for suddenly
he heard the thud of a minie ball. Calmly riding on, he remarked to
General Gordon at his side, &ldquo;You see how much better fixed for a fight
I am than you are. It don&rsquo;t hurt at all to be shot in a wooden leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A momentous decision now had to be made. Lee had reached the field
at 3 p.&nbsp;m., and had witnessed the retreat of the disorganized Union
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
troops through the streets of Gettysburg. Through his glasses he had
watched their attempt to reestablish their lines on Cemetery Hill.
Sensing his advantage and a great opportunity, he sent orders to Ewell
by a staff officer to &ldquo;press those people&rdquo; and secure the hill (Cemetery
Hill) if possible. However, two of Ewell&rsquo;s divisions, those of Rodes and
Early, had been heavily engaged throughout the afternoon and were not
well in hand. Johnson&rsquo;s division could not reach the field until late in
the evening, and the reconnaissance service of Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry was not
yet available. General Ewell, uninformed of the Union strength in the
rear of the hills south of Gettysburg, decided to await the arrival of
Johnson&rsquo;s division. Cemetery Hill was not attacked, and Johnson,
coming up late in the evening, stopped at the base of Culp&rsquo;s Hill. Thus
passed Lee&rsquo;s opportunity of July 1.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">

<p class="pcap"><i>Scene north of Gettysburg from Oak Ridge. The Federal position

</div>
<p>When the Union troops retreated from the battleground north and
west of the town on the evening of July 1, they hastily occupied defense
positions on Cemetery Hill, Culp&rsquo;s Hill, and a part of Cemetery Ridge.
Upon the arrival of Slocum by the Baltimore Pike and Sickles by way
of the Emmitsburg Road, the Union right flank at Culp&rsquo;s Hill and
Spangler&rsquo;s Spring and the important position at Little Round Top on
the left were consolidated. Thus was developed a strong defensive battle
line in the shape of a fish hook, about 3 miles long, with the advantage
of high ground and of interior lines. Opposite, in a semicircle about 6
miles long, extending down Seminary Ridge and into the streets of
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
Gettysburg, stood the Confederates who, during the night, had closed
in from the north and west.</p>
<p>The greater part of the citizenry of Gettysburg, despite the prospect
of battle in their own yards, chose to remain in their homes. Both army
commanders respected noncombatant rights to a marked degree. Thus,
in contrast with the fields of carnage all about the village, life and
property of the civilian population remained unharmed, while the doors
of churches, schools, and homes were opened for the care of the
wounded.</p>
<p>General Meade, at Taneytown, had learned early in the afternoon of
July 1 that a battle was developing and that Reynolds had been killed.
A large part of his army was within 5 miles of Gettysburg. Meade then
sent General Hancock to study and report on the situation. Hancock
reached the field just as the Union troops were falling back to Cemetery
Hill. He helped to rally the troops and left at 6 o&rsquo;clock to report to
Meade that in his opinion the battle should be fought at Gettysburg.
Meade acted on this recommendation and immediately ordered the concentration
of the Union forces at that place. Meade himself arrived near
midnight on July 1.</p>

<h3 id="c7">PRELIMINARY MOVEMENTS AND PLANS.</h3>
<p>The small college town of
Gettysburg, with 2,400 residents at the time of the battle, lay in the
heart of a fertile country, surrounded by broad acres of crops and
pastures. Substantial houses of industrious Pennsylvania farmers dotted
the countryside. South of the town and hardly more than a musket shot
from the houses on its outer edge, Cemetery Hill rose somewhat abruptly
from the lower ground. Extending southward from the hill for nearly 2
miles was a long roll of land called Cemetery Ridge. At its southern extremity
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
a sharp incline terminated in the wooded crest of Little Round
Top and a half mile beyond was the sugar-loaf peak of Big Round Top,
the highest point in the vicinity of Gettysburg. Paralleling Cemetery
Ridge, at an average distance of two-thirds of a mile to the west, lay
Seminary Ridge, which derived its name from the Lutheran Seminary
that stood upon its crest a half mile west of Gettysburg. In 1863, 10
roads radiated from Gettysburg, the one leading to Emmitsburg extending
diagonally across the valley between Seminary and Cemetery Ridges.</p>

<p>By noon of July 2, the powerful forces of Meade and Lee were at hand,
and battle on a tremendous scale was imminent. That part of the Union
line extending from Cemetery Hill to Little Round Top was strongly
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
held. Late in the forenoon, Sickles, commanding the Third Corps which
lay north of Little Round Top, sent Berdan&rsquo;s sharpshooters and some of
the men of the 3rd Maine Regiment forward from the Emmitsburg Road
to Pitzer&rsquo;s Woods, a half mile to the west. As they reached the woods,
a strong Confederate force fired upon them, and they hurriedly retired
to inform their commander. To Sickles, the extension of the Confederate
line southward meant that his left flank was endangered. He at once
began moving forward to the advantageous high ground at the Peach
Orchard, and by 3:30 p.&nbsp;m. his battle front extended from Devil&rsquo;s Den
northwestward to the Orchard and northward on the Emmitsburg Road.
In this forward movement, the strong position on the crest of Little
Round Top was left unoccupied. This was the situation when Meade
finally turned his attention from his right flank at Culp&rsquo;s Hill and
Spangler&rsquo;s Spring&mdash;the cause of his great concern throughout the
forenoon&mdash;to review Sickles&rsquo; line.</p>

<p>Lee planned to attack, despite the advice of Longstreet who continually
urged defensive battle. On July 2, Longstreet recommended that Lee
swing around the Union left at Little Round Top, select a good position,
and await attack. Lee observed that while the Union position was strong
if held in sufficient numbers to utilize the advantage of interior lines, it
presented grave difficulties to a weak defending force. A secure lodgment
on the shank of the hook might render it possible to sever the Union
Army and to deal with each unit separately. Not all of Meade&rsquo;s force had
reached the field, and Lee thought he had the opportunity of destroying
his adversary in the process of concentration. He resolved to send
Longstreet against the Federal left flank which he believed was then on
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
lower Cemetery Ridge, while Ewell was to storm Cemetery Hill and
Culp&rsquo;s Hill.</p>

<p>In the execution of this plan,
Longstreet was ordered to take position across the Emmitsburg Road
and to attack what was thought to be the left flank of the Union line on
Cemetery Ridge. From his encampment on the Chambersburg Road, 3
miles west of Gettysburg, he started toward his objective, using Herr
Ridge to conceal the movement from Union signalmen on Little Round
Top. After marching to Black Horse Tavern on the Fairfield Road, he
realized that his troops were in sight of the signal unit and at once began
retracing his course. Employing the trees on Seminary Ridge as a screen,
he marched southward again in Willoughby Run Valley, arriving in
position on the Emmitsburg Road about 3:30 p.&nbsp;m. Immediately in front,
and only 700 yards away, Longstreet saw Sickles&rsquo; batteries lined up in the
Peach Orchard and on the Emmitsburg Road. Col. E.&nbsp;P. Alexander,
commanding a battalion of Longstreet&rsquo;s artillery, opened with full force
against the Union guns. Longstreet could observe in the distance that
Little Round Top was unoccupied. Law&rsquo;s Alabama troops were directed
at once to take the hill, and Robertson&rsquo;s Texans were instructed to join
in the charge.</p>

of Engineers, having assisted Sickles in placing his line, now rode to the
crest of Little Round Top and found the hill, &ldquo;the key to the Union position,&rdquo;
unoccupied except by a signal station. Warren was informed by
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the signalmen that they believed Confederate troops lay concealed on
the wooded ridge a mile to the west. Smith&rsquo;s New York battery, emplaced
at Devil&rsquo;s Den, immediately was ordered to fire a shot into these woods.
The missile, crashing through the trees, caused a sudden stir of the
Confederates &ldquo;which by the gleam of the reflected sunlight on their
bayonets, revealed their long lines outflanking the position.&rdquo; Warren
realized Longstreet would strike first at Little Round Top and he observed,
too, the difficulty of shifting Sickles&rsquo; position from Devil&rsquo;s Den
to the hill.</p>

</div>
<p>At this moment Warren noticed the approach of Union troops from
the north and rode to meet them. They were Vincent&rsquo;s and Weed&rsquo;s
brigades, leading Sykes&rsquo; corps from reserve position to the front. Intercepting
these troops, Warren rushed them to Little Round Top. Law&rsquo;s
Alabama troops were starting to scale the south slope of the hill when
Vincent&rsquo;s men rushed to the attack. Weed&rsquo;s brigade, following closely,
drove over the crest and engaged Robertson&rsquo;s Texans on the west slope.
The arrival of Hazlett&rsquo;s battery on the summit of the hill is thus described
by an eyewitness: &ldquo;The passage of the six guns through the
roadless woods and amongst the rocks was marvelous. Under ordinary
circumstances it would have been considered an impossible feat, but the
eagerness of the men ... brought them without delay to the very
summit, where they went immediately into battle.&rdquo; A desperate hand-to-hand
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
struggle ensued. Weed and Hazlett were killed, and Vincent was
mortally wounded&mdash;all young soldiers of great promise.</p>
<p>The struggle at Little Round Top now became stalemated, and Longstreet
directed his entire line to attack. The Confederate drive was taken
up in turn by the brigades of Benning, Anderson, Kershaw, Semmes,
Barksdale, Wofford, Wilcox, Perry, and Wright against the divisions of
Birney and Humphreys in the Wheatfield, the Peach Orchard, and along
the Emmitsburg Road. Four hours of desperate fighting broke the Peach
Orchard salient, an angle in the Union line which was struck from the
south and the west. It left the Wheatfield strewn with dead and wounded,
and the base of Little Round Top a shambles. Sickles&rsquo; men had been
driven back, and Longstreet was now in possession of the west slope of
Big Round Top, of Devil&rsquo;s Den, and the Peach Orchard. Little Round
Top, that commanding landmark from which Longstreet had hoped to
shell the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge and Cemetery Hill, still
remained in Union possession.</p>
<h3 id="c10">CULP&rsquo;S HILL.</h3>
<p>In the Confederate plan, Ewell on the left was directed to
attack Cemetery Hill and Culp&rsquo;s Hill in conjunction with Longstreet&rsquo;s
drive. At the appointed time, the guns of Latimer&rsquo;s battalion on Benner&rsquo;s
Hill, east of Gettysburg, opened a well-directed fire against the Union
positions on East Cemetery Hill and Culp&rsquo;s Hill, but the return fire
soon shattered many of Latimer&rsquo;s batteries and forced the remnants to
retire out of range. In the final moments of this action the youthful
Major Latimer was mortally wounded.</p>

</div>
<p>About dusk, long after the artillery fire had ceased, Early&rsquo;s infantry
started a charge toward East Cemetery Hill. Seldom, if ever, surpassed
in its dash and desperation, Early&rsquo;s assault reached the crest of the hill
where the defenders, as a last resort in the hand-to-hand encounter, used
clubbed muskets, stones, and rammers. Long after dark, the Louisiana
Tigers and their comrades, in possession of the crest of the hill, fought
to hold their gain and their captured guns. The failure of Rodes to
move out of the streets of Gettysburg and to attack the hill from the
west enabled Hancock to shift some of his men to aid in repelling
Early&rsquo;s attacks. Faced by these Union reserves, Early&rsquo;s men finally gave
way about 10 o&rsquo;clock and sullenly retired to their lines. The Union troops
stood firm.</p>
<p>Closely timed with Early&rsquo;s assault of East Cemetery Hill, Johnson&rsquo;s
division charged the Union works on Culp&rsquo;s Hill. Failing to make headway,
because of the steep incline and the strength of the Union positions,
Johnson fell back across Rock Creek and started an attack on the southern
slope of the hill. Here the Union works were thinly manned. An
hour earlier, the divisions of Geary and Ruger had been called from
those works to the aid of the Sickles line at the Peach Orchard. Johnson,
finding the works weakly defended, took possession of them but did not
press the attack farther. Only a few hundred yards away on the Baltimore
Pike lay the Union supply trains. The failure of Confederate reconnaissance
here again was critically important. Thus passed another opportunity
to strike a hard blow at the Union Army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>The Third Day</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c12">CANNONADE AT DAWN: CULP&rsquo;S HILL AND SPANGLER&rsquo;S SPRING.</h3>
<p>Night
brought an end to the bloody combat at East Cemetery Hill, but this
was not the time for rest. What would Meade do? Would the Union
Army remain in its established position and hold its lines at all costs?
At midnight Meade sought the advice of his Council of War in the east
room of his headquarters. The corps commanders&mdash;Gibbon, Williams,
Sykes, Newton, Howard, Hancock, Sedgwick, and Slocum&mdash;without exception
advised holding the positions established. Meade, approving,
turned to the officer whose division held the Union center, and said,
&ldquo;Gibbon, if Lee attacks me tomorrow it will be on your front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meade on the following morning began to fortify Cemetery Ridge by
shifting all units that could be spared from the line at Culp&rsquo;s Hill, and
those in reserve at the Round Tops and on Cemetery Hill. General Hunt,
Chief of Artillery, brought up reserve batteries to hold in readiness for
replacement of front line guns. Throughout the forenoon of the third
day, Meade not only developed a strong front at the stone walls on the
crest of the ridge, but he also strengthened his reserve power to an extent
which rendered the Union center almost impregnable.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">

<p class="pcap"><i>Interior of breastworks on Little Round Top.</i> (Brady photograph.)</p>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, important movements were occurring elsewhere on the
field. Ruger&rsquo;s division and Lockwood&rsquo;s brigade, which had been called
from their lines on the south slope of Culp&rsquo;s Hill the previous evening
to help defend Sickles&rsquo; position at the Peach Orchard, were now countermarching,
under cover of darkness, to reoccupy their ground. Geary,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
who had misunderstood orders and had marched down the Baltimore
Pike, was also returning to his works. Ruger&rsquo;s men, upon reaching the
Pike, learned from scouts that their entrenchments south of Culp&rsquo;s Hill
and at Spangler&rsquo;s Spring had been occupied by the Confederates. Ruger,
resolving upon an attack at daybreak, organized his forces along the
Pike. Powerful artillery units under Muhlenberg were brought into place
along the road; Rigby&rsquo;s Maryland battery was stationed on Power&rsquo;s Hill,
a prominent knoll a half mile to the south; and another battery was
emplaced on McAllister Hill.</p>

</div>
<p>As dawn broke on July 3, Union guns on the Baltimore Pike opened
with a heavy cannonade on Johnson&rsquo;s Confederates at Spangler&rsquo;s Spring.
The heavily wooded area about the Confederate lines prevented them
from bringing guns into position to return the fire. Union skirmishers
began streaming across the field toward the Confederate entrenchments.
The full force of Ruger&rsquo;s and Geary&rsquo;s brigades followed closely. Throughout
the forenoon the Union troops struck again and again.</p>
<p>It was about 10 o&rsquo;clock that Ruger, believing that a flank attack might
break the resistance of Johnson&rsquo;s men, ordered Col. Silas Colgrove to
strike the Confederate left flank near the spring. The troops of the 2d
Massachusetts and the 19th Indiana regiments started across the swale
from the cover of the woods on the little hill south of the spring. A
withering fire slowed their pace, but they charged on, only to have their
ranks decimated by the Confederates in strong positions back of a stone
wall. Colonel Mudge, inspiring leader of the Massachusetts regiment,
fell mortally wounded. Forced to fall back, the men soon learned their
efforts had not been in vain. On Ruger&rsquo;s and Geary&rsquo;s front the Confederates
were now giving way and soon had retired across Rock Creek,
out of striking range. By 11 o&rsquo;clock, the Union troops were again in
possession of their earthworks; again they could quench their thirst in
the cooling waters of the spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h3 id="c13">LEE PLANS A FINAL THRUST.</h3>
<p>General Lee must have learned by mid-forenoon,
after the long hours of struggle at Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Spangler&rsquo;s
Spring, that his troops could not hold the Union works which they had
occupied with so little effort the previous evening. He had seen, also,
that in the tremendous battling during the preceding afternoon no important
gains had been made at Little Round Top and its vicinity.
Longstreet had gained the advantageous ridge at the Peach Orchard and
had brought his batteries forward from Pitzer&rsquo;s Woods to this high
ground in preparation for a follow-up attack. Wright&rsquo;s brigade, the last
unit to move forward on July 2 in the echelon attack begun by General
Law, had charged across the open fields at dusk and pierced the Union
center just south of the copse of trees on Cemetery Ridge. Wright&rsquo;s
success could not be pressed to decisive advantage as the brigades on his
left had not moved forward to his support, and he was forced to retire.
Again, lack of coordination in attack was to count heavily against the
Confederates.</p>
<p>The failure to make any pronounced headway on July 2 at Culp&rsquo;s Hill
and Little Round Top, and the momentary success of Wright on
Cemetery Ridge, doubtless led Lee to believe that Meade&rsquo;s flanks were
strong and his center weak. A powerful drive at the center might pierce
the enemy&rsquo;s lines and fold them back. The shattered units might then
be destroyed or captured at will. Such a charge across open fields and in
the face of frontal and flank fire would, Lee well understood, be a gamble
seldom undertaken. Longstreet strongly voiced his objection to such a
move, insisting that &ldquo;no 15,000 men ever arrayed for battle can take that
position.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">

</div>
<p>Time now was the important element. Whatever could be done must
be done quickly. Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; divisions, who had fought bravely
and lost heavily at Round Top and the Wheatfield, were not in condition
for another severe test. Early and Johnson on the left had likewise
endured long, unrelenting battle with powerful Union forces in positions
of advantage. The men of Heth&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions had not
been heavily engaged since the first day&rsquo;s encounter west of Gettysburg.
These were the men, along with Pickett&rsquo;s division, whom Lee would
have to count on to bear the brunt of his final great effort at Gettysburg.</p>
<h3 id="c14">LEE AND MEADE SET THE STAGE.</h3>
<p>Late in the forenoon of July 3, General
Meade had completed his plan of defense in rear of the Union center by
the concentration of all available infantry units. General Hunt, sensing
the danger, placed a solid line of batteries in position on the crest of the
ridge and brought others to the rear for emergency use. As a final act of
preparation, Meade inspected his front at the stone wall, then rode
southward to Little Round Top. Here, with General Warren, he could
see the long lines of Confederate batteries and the massing of troops, a
sure indication of attack. Meade rode back to his headquarters.</p>
<p>Lee, on his part, had observed in the forenoon the enemy in the process
of concentration on Cemetery Ridge. Having reached his decision
to strike the Union center, he had already begun the movement of batteries
from the rear to points of advantage. By noon, 138 guns were in
line from the Peach Orchard northward to the Seminary buildings, many
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of them only 800 yards from the Union center. To Colonel Alexander
fell the lot of directing the artillery fire and informing the infantry of
the best opportunity to advance.</p>
<p>Massed to the west of Emmitsburg Road, on low ground which
screened their position from the Union lines, lay Gen. George Pickett&rsquo;s
three brigades commanded by Kemper, Armistead, and Garnett. Pickett&rsquo;s
men had arrived the previous evening from Chambersburg, where they
had guarded Lee&rsquo;s wagons on July 1 and 2. As the only fresh body of
troops on the field, they were now to spearhead the charge. On Pickett&rsquo;s
left, the attacking front was fast being organized. Joseph Pettigrew, a
brigadier, was preparing to lead the division of the wounded Major
General Heth and Maj. Gen. Isaac Trimble took the command of
Pender. More than 10,000 troops of these two divisions&mdash;including such
units as the 26th North Carolina whose losses on the first day were so
heavy that the dead marked their advance &ldquo;with the accuracy of a line
at a dress parade&rdquo;&mdash;now awaited the order to attack. Many hours earlier,
the Bliss farm buildings, which lay in their front, had been burned. Their
objective on the ridge was in clear view. The brigades of Wilcox and
Lang were to move forward on the right of Pickett in order to protect
his flank as he neared the enemy position.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p14a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="503" />
<p class="pcap"><i>The Round Tops as they appear from Longstreet&rsquo;s battle line

</div>
<p>General Stuart, in the meantime, had been out of touch with Lee.
Moving northward on the right flank of the Union Army, he became
involved in a sharp engagement at Hanover, Pa., on June 30. Seeking to
regain contact with Lee, he arrived at Carlisle on the evening of July 1.
As he began shelling the barracks, orders arrived from Lee and he at
once marched for Gettysburg, arriving north of the town the next day.
Lee now decided to employ his cavalry to cut off Union retreat which
might result from a successful attack on the center. Stuart was instructed
to swing eastward and then south around Gettysburg the morning of
July 3 in order to arrive in the rear of the Union lines at the time Pickett
was expected to charge the center.</p>

</div>
<p>Except for the intermittent sniping of sharpshooters, an ominous
silence prevailed over the fields. The orders had now been given; the
objective had been pointed out. Men talked of casual things. Some
munched on hard bread, others looked fearfully to the eastward, where,
with the same mixed feelings, lay their adversary.</p>
<p>Far to the south, on another crucial front, General Pemberton was
penning a letter to General Grant asking terms for the surrender of
Vicksburg. In Richmond, the sick and anxious Jefferson Davis looked
hopefully for heartening word from his great field commander at
Gettysburg. The outcome of this bold venture would count heavily in
the balance for the cause of the Confederacy.</p>
<h3 id="c15">ARTILLERY DUEL AT ONE O&rsquo;CLOCK.</h3>
<p>At 1 o&rsquo;clock two guns of Miller&rsquo;s
Battery, posted near the Peach Orchard, opened fire in rapid succession.
It was the signal for the entire line to let loose their terrific blast.
Gunners rushed to their cannon, and in a few moments the massed batteries
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
shook the countryside. Firing in salvos and in succession, the air
was soon filled with smoke and heavy dust, which darkened the sky.
Union gunners on Cemetery Ridge waited a few minutes until the positions
of the Confederate batteries were located; then 80 guns, placed it
close order, opened fire. For nearly 2 hours the duel continued, then that
Union fire slackened. Hunt had ordered a partial cessation in order to
cool the guns and to replace broken carriages.</p>

<p>Colonel Alexander, in position on the Emmitsburg Road near the
Peach Orchard, could observe the effectiveness of his fire on the Union
lines and also keep the Confederate troops in view. To him, it appeared
that Union artillery fire was weakening. His own supply of ammunition
was running low. Believing this was the time to attack, Alexander sent
a message to Pickett who in turn rode over to Longstreet. General
Longstreet, who had persistently opposed Lee&rsquo;s plan of sending 15,000
men across the open ground, was now faced with a final decision. Longstreet
merely nodded approval and Pickett saluted, saying, &ldquo;I am going
to move forward, sir.&rdquo; He rode back to his men and ordered the advance.
With Kemper on the right, Garnett on the left, and Armistead a few
yards to the rear, the division marched out in brigade front, first northeastward
into the open fields, then eastward toward the Union lines. As
Pickett&rsquo;s men came into view near the woods, Pettigrew and Trimble
gave the order to advance. The troops of the Carolinas, Tennessee, and
Mississippi, comprising the brigades of Mayo, Davis, Marshall, and Fry
in front, followed closely by Lane and Lowrance, now moved out to
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
attack. A gap of half a mile between Pickett&rsquo;s left and Pettigrew&rsquo;s right
would be closed as the advance progressed. The units were to converge
as they approached the Union lines so that the final stage of the charge
would present a solid front.</p>
<h3 id="c16">CLIMAX AT GETTYSBURG.</h3>
<p>Billows of smoke lay ahead of the Union men
at the stone wall, momentarily obscuring the enemy. But trained observers
on Little Round Top, far to the south, could see in the rear of
this curtain of smoke the waves of Confederates starting forward. Pickett,
finding his brigades drifting southeastward, ordered them to bear to the
left, and the men turned toward the copse of trees. Kemper was now approaching
on the south of the Codori buildings; Garnett and Armistead
were on the north. Halted momentarily at the Emmitsburg Road to
remove fence rails, Pickett&rsquo;s troops, with Pettigrew on the left, renewed
the advance. Pickett had anticipated frontal fire of artillery and infantry
from the strong Union positions at the stone walls on the ridge, but now
an unforeseen attack developed. Union guns as far south as Little Round
Top, along with batteries on Cemetery Hill, relieved from Confederate
fire at the Seminary buildings, opened on the right and left flanks. As
Pickett&rsquo;s men drove toward the Union works at The Angle, Stannard&rsquo;s
Vermont troops, executing a right turn movement from their position
south of the copse, fired into the flank of the charging Confederates.
The advancing lines crumbled, re-formed, and again pressed ahead under
terrific fire from the Union batteries.</p>

</div>
<p>A hundred yards from the stone wall, in the tall grass, they encountered
Union skirmishers who fired and hastily withdrew. But all along the
wall the Union infantry opened with volley after volley into the depleted
ranks of Garnett and Fry. Armistead closed in, and with Lane and
Lowrance joining him, made a last concerted drive. At this close range,
double canister and concentrated infantry fire cut wide gaps in the attacking
front. Garnett was mortally wounded; Kemper was down, his
lines falling away on the right and left. Armistead reached the low stone
fence. In a final surge, he crossed the wall with 150 men and, with his
cap on his sword, shouted &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; At the peak of the charge, he
fell mortally wounded. From the ridge, Union troops rushed forward
and Hall&rsquo;s Michigan regiments let loose a blast of musketry. The gray
column was surrounded. The tide of the Confederacy had &ldquo;swept to its
crest, paused, and receded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the divisions in the charge were reduced to mere fragments.
In front of the Union line, 20 fallen battle flags lay in a space of 100
yards square. Singly and in little clumps, the remnants of the gray
columns that had made the magnificent charge of a few minutes earlier
now sullenly retreated across the fields toward the Confederate lines. Lee,
who had watched anxiously from Spangler&rsquo;s Woods, now rode out to
meet his men. &ldquo;All this has been my fault,&rdquo; he said to General Wilcox
who had brought off his command after heavy losses. &ldquo;It is I that have
lost this fight, and you must help me out of it in the best way you can.&rdquo;
And again that night, in a moment of contemplation, he remarked to a
comrade, &ldquo;Too bad! too bad! Oh! too bad!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c17">CAVALRY ACTION.</h3>
<p>As the strength of Lee&rsquo;s mighty effort at The Angle
was ebbing and the scattered remnants of the charge were seeking
shelter, action of a different kind was taking place on another field not
far distant. Early in the afternoon, Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry was making its way
down the valley of Cress Run, 3 miles east of Gettysburg. The brigades
of Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee, at the rear of the line of march, momentarily
lost the trail and came out into open ground at the north end of
Rummel&rsquo;s Woods. Stuart, soon learning of the mistake, attempted to
bring them into line and to proceed southward. But at this point, Gen.
D.&nbsp;M. Gregg&rsquo;s Union cavalry, in position along the Hanover Road a
mile southeast, saw the Confederates. Gregg prepared at once to attack,
and Stuart had no choice but to fight on this ground. As the two forces
moved closer, dismounted men opened a brisk fire, supported by the
accurate shelling of artillerists.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Then came the initial cavalry charge and countercharge. The Confederate
Jenkins was forced to withdraw when his small supply of
ammunition became exhausted. Hampton, Fitzhugh Lee, and Chambliss
charged again and again, only to be met with the equally spirited
counterattack of McIntosh. Custer&rsquo;s Michigan regiments closed in on
a flank movement against the right of the charging Confederate troopers,
and Miller&rsquo;s squadron of the 3d Pennsylvania, disobeying orders to
hold its position, struck opportunely on the Confederate left. The thrusts
of the Union horsemen, so well coordinated, stopped the onslaught of
Stuart&rsquo;s troopers. After 3 hours of driving assaults, the Confederates left
the field and retired to the north of Gettysburg. The Union horsemen,
holding their ground, had successfully cut off the prospect of Confederate
cavalry aid in the rear of the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><i>End of Invasion</i></span></h2>
<p>Lee, as he looked over the desolate field of dead and wounded and the

battle, must have realized that not only was Gettysburg lost, but that
eventually it might all end this way. Meade did not counterattack, as
expected. The following day, July 4, the two armies lay facing each
other, exhausted and torn.</p>

<p>Late on the afternoon of July 4, Lee began an orderly retreat. The
wagon train of wounded, 17 miles in length, guarded by Imboden&rsquo;s
cavalry, started homeward through Greenwood and Greencastle. At
night, the able-bodied men marched over the Hagerstown Road by way
of Monterey Pass to the Potomac. Roads had become nearly impassable
from the heavy rains that day. So well did Stuart cover the retreat that
the army reached the Potomac with comparatively little loss. Meade,
realizing that the Confederate Army was actually retreating and not
retiring to the mountain passes, sent his cavalry and Sedgwick&rsquo;s corps of
infantry in pursuit and ordered the mountain passes west of Frederick
covered. Lee, having the advantage of the more direct route to the
Potomac, reached the river several days ahead of his pursuers, but heavy
rains had swollen the current and he could not cross. Meade arrived on
the night of July 12 and prepared for a general attack. On the following
night, however, the river receded and Lee crossed safely into Virginia.
The Confederate Army, Meade&rsquo;s critics said, had been permitted to slip
from the Union grasp.</p>

<h3 id="c20">ESTABLISHMENT OF A BURIAL GROUND.</h3>
<p>For the residents of Gettysburg
the aftermath of battle was almost as trying as the 3 days of struggle that
had swirled about them. The town&rsquo;s 2,400 inhabitants, and the nearby
country folk, bore a heavy share of the burden of caring for the 21,000
wounded and dying of both sides, who were left behind when the armies
moved on. Spacious rooms in churches and schools and hundreds of
homes were turned over to the care of the wounded; and kindly folk
from neighboring towns came to help those of Gettysburg in ministering
to the needs of the maimed and shattered men.</p>
<p>Adequate attention to the wounded was an immediate necessity, but
fully as urgent was the need of caring for the dead. Nearly 6,000 had
been killed in action, and hundreds died each day from mortal wounds.
In the earlier stages of the battle, soldiers of both armies performed the
tasks of burying their fallen comrades, but the struggle had reached such
large proportions and the scene of battle had so shifted that fallen men
had come within enemy lines. Because of the emergencies of battle,
therefore, hundreds of bodies had been left unburied or only partially
covered. It was evident that the limited aid which could be offered by
local authorities must be supported by a well-organized plan for disinterment
of the dead from the temporary burial grounds on the field
and reburial in a permanent place at Gettysburg or in home cemeteries.</p>
<p>A few days after the battle, the Governor of the Commonwealth, Hon.
Andrew Curtin, visited the battlefield to offer assistance in caring for the
wounded. When official duties required his return to Harrisburg, he
appointed Attorney David Wills, of Gettysburg, to act as his special
agent. At the time of his visit, the Governor was especially distressed by
the condition of the dead. In response to the Governor&rsquo;s desire that the
remains be brought together in a place set aside for the purpose, Mr.
Wills selected land on the northern slope of Cemetery Hill and suggested
that the State of Pennsylvania purchase the ground at once in
order that interments could begin without delay. He proposed that contributions
for the purpose of laying out and landscaping the grounds be
asked from legislatures of the States whose soldiers had taken part in the
battle.</p>
<p>Within 6 weeks, Mr. Wills had purchased 17 acres of ground on
Cemetery Hill and engaged William Saunders, an eminent landscape
gardener, to lay out the grounds in State lots, apportioned in size to the
number of graves for the fallen of each State. Each of the Union States
represented in the battle made contributions for planning and landscaping.</p>
<p>The reinterment of 3,512 bodies in the cemetery was accomplished
only after many months. Great care had been taken to identify the bodies
on the field, and, at the time of reinterment, remains were readily identified
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
by marked boards which had been placed at the field grave or by
items found on the bodies. Even so, the names of 1,664 remained unknown,
979 of whom were without identification either by name or by
State. Within a year, appropriations from the States made possible the
enclosure of the cemetery with a massive stone wall and an iron fence
on the Baltimore Street front, imposing gateways of iron, headstones for
the graves, and a keeper&rsquo;s lodge. Since the original burials, the total of
Civil War interments has reached 3,706. Including those of later wars,
the total number now is 4,399.</p>

</div>
<p>The removal of Confederate dead from the field burial plots was not
undertaken until 7 years after the battle. During the years 1870-73, upon
the initiative of the Ladies Memorial Associations of Richmond, Raleigh,
Savannah, and Charleston, 3,320 bodies were disinterred and sent to
cemeteries in those cities for reburial, 2,935 being interred in Hollywood
Cemetery, Richmond. Seventy-three bodies were reburied in home
cemeteries.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania incorporated the cemetery in
January 1864. The cemetery &ldquo;having been completed, and the care of it
by Commissioners from so many states being burdensome and expensive,&rdquo;
the Board of Commissioners, authorized by act of the General
Assembly of Pennsylvania in 1868, recommended the transfer of the
cemetery to the Federal Government. The Secretary of War accepted title
to the cemetery for the United States Government on May 1, 1872.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h3 id="c21">DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY.</h3>
<p>Having agreed upon a plan for the
cemetery, the Commissioners believed it advisable to consecrate the
grounds with appropriate ceremonies. Mr. Wills, representing the
Governor of Pennsylvania, was selected to make proper arrangements
for the event. With the approval of the Governors of the several States,
he wrote to Hon. Edward Everett, of Massachusetts, inviting him to
deliver the oration on the occasion and suggested October 23, 1863, as
the date for the ceremony. Mr. Everett stated in reply that the invitation
was a great compliment, but that because of the time necessary for the
preparation of the oration he could not accept a date earlier than
November 19. This was the date agreed upon.</p>
<p>Edward Everett was the outstanding orator of his day. He had been a
prominent Boston minister and later a university professor. A cultured
scholar, he had delivered orations on many notable occasions. In a distinguished
career he became successively President of Harvard, Governor
of Massachusetts, United States Senator, Minister to England, and
Secretary of State.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Wills house where Lincoln was a guest when the national

</div>
<p>The Gettysburg cemetery, at the time of the dedication, was not under
the authority of the Federal Government. It had not occurred to those
in charge, therefore, that the President of the United States might desire
to attend the ceremony. When formally printed invitations were sent to
a rather extended list of national figures, including the President, the
acceptance from Mr. Lincoln came as a surprise. Mr. Wills was thereupon
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
instructed to request the President to take part in the program,
and, on November 2, a personal invitation was addressed to him.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The procession on Baltimore Street en route to the cemetery for

</div>
<p>Throngs filled the town on the evening of November 18. The special
train from Washington bearing the President arrived in Gettysburg at
dusk. Mr. Lincoln was escorted to the spacious home of Mr. Wills on
Center Square. Sometime later in the evening the President was serenaded,
and at a late hour he retired. At 10 o&rsquo;clock on the following
morning, the appointed time for the procession to begin, Mr. Lincoln
was ready. The various units of the long procession, marshaled by Ward
Lamon, began moving on Baltimore Street, the President riding horseback.
The elaborate order of march also included Cabinet officials, judges
of the Supreme Court, high military officers, Governors, commissioners,
the Vice President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Members
of Congress, and many local groups.</p>
<p>Difficulty in getting the procession under way and the tardy return of
Mr. Everett from his drive over the battleground accounted for a delay
of an hour in the proceedings. At high noon, with thousands scurrying
about for points of vantage, the ceremonies were begun with the playing
of a dirge by one of the bands. As the audience stood uncovered, a
prayer was offered by Rev. Thomas H. Stockton, Chaplain of the House
of Representatives. &ldquo;Old Hundred&rdquo; was played by the Marine Band.
Then Mr. Everett arose, and &ldquo;stood a moment in silence, regarding the
battlefield and the distant beauty of the South Mountain range.&rdquo; For
nearly 2 hours he reviewed the funeral customs of Athens, spoke of the
purposes of war, presented a detailed account of the 3-days&rsquo; battle, offered
tribute to those who died on the battlefield, and reminded his audience
of the bonds which are common to all Americans. Upon the conclusion
of his address, a hymn was sung.</p>

</div>
<p>Then the President arose and spoke his immortal words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent,
a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all
men are created equal.</i></p>
<p><i>Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</i></p>
<p><i>But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate&mdash;we cannot consecrate&mdash;we
cannot hallow&mdash;this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to
be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the
great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died
in vain&mdash;that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom&mdash;and
that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A hymn was then sung and Rev. H.&nbsp;L. Baugher pronounced the
benediction.</p>

<h3 id="c22">GENESIS OF THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.</h3>
<p>The theme of the Gettysburg
Address was not entirely new. &ldquo;Must a government, of necessity, be too
strong for the liberties of its people,&rdquo; Lincoln had once asked, &ldquo;or too
weak to maintain its own existence?&rdquo; Speaking of war aims, he said,
&ldquo;We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.&rdquo; When
he referred at Gettysburg to &ldquo;the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced,&rdquo; he had in mind the high
purpose of the preservation of the Union and the welfare of all the
people. More than a year after Gettysburg, Lincoln in his Second
Inaugural address uttered words which might very well be considered a
companion sentiment to those expressed at Gettysburg: &ldquo;With malice
toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right as God
gives us to see the right.&rdquo; This profession of faith came from the heart
of a man of humility who sought then, as he did throughout the war, to
assuage suffering and anxiety everywhere.</p>
<p>Rather than accept the address as a few brief notes hastily prepared on
the route to Gettysburg (an assumption which has long gained much
public acceptance), it should be regarded as a pronouncement of the high
purpose dominant in Lincoln&rsquo;s thinking throughout the war. Habitually
cautious of words in public address, spoken or written, it is not likely
that the President, on such an occasion, failed to give careful thought to
the words which he would speak. After receiving the belated invitation
on November 2, he yet had ample time to prepare for the occasion, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
the well-known correspondent Noah Brooks stated that several days
before the dedication Lincoln told him in Washington that his address
would be &ldquo;short, short, short&rdquo; and that it was &ldquo;written, but not finished.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="c23">THE FIVE AUTOGRAPH COPIES OF THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS.</h3>
<p>Even after
his arrival at Gettysburg the President continued to put finishing touches
to his address. The first page of the original text was written in ink on
a sheet of Executive Mansion paper. The second page, either written or
revised at the Wills residence, was in pencil on a sheet of foolscap, and,
according to Lincoln&rsquo;s secretary, Nicolay, the few words changed in
pencil at the bottom of the first page were added while in Gettysburg.
The second draft of the address was written in Gettysburg probably on
the morning of its delivery, as it contains certain phrases that are not in
the first draft but are in the reports of the address as delivered and in
subsequent copies made by Lincoln. It is probable, as stated in the explanatory
note accompanying the original copies of the first and second
drafts in the Library of Congress, that it was the second draft which
Lincoln held in his hand when he delivered the address.</p>
<p>Quite opposite to Lincoln&rsquo;s feeling, expressed soon after the delivery
of the address, that it &ldquo;would not scour,&rdquo; the President lived long enough
to think better of it himself and to see it widely accepted as a masterpiece.
Early in 1864, Mr. Everett requested him to join in presenting
manuscripts of the two addresses given at Gettysburg to be bound in a
volume and sold for the benefit of stricken soldiers at a Sanitary Commission
Fair in New York. The draft Lincoln sent became the third
autograph copy, known as the Everett-Keyes copy, and it is now in the
possession of the Illinois State Historical Library.</p>
<p>George Bancroft requested a copy in April 1864, to be included in
<i>Autograph Leaves of Our Country&rsquo;s Authors</i>. This volume was to be sold
at a Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo; Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. As this fourth copy
was written on both sides of the paper, it proved unusable for this purpose,
and Mr. Bancroft was allowed to keep it. This autograph draft is
known as the Bancroft copy, as it remained in that family for many years.
It has recently been presented to the Cornell University Library. Finding
that the copy written for <i>Autograph Leaves</i> could not be used, Mr.
Lincoln wrote another, a fifth draft, which was accepted for the purpose
requested. It is the only draft to which he affixed his signature. In all
probability it was the last copy written by Lincoln, and because of the apparent
care in its preparation it has become the standard version of the
address. The fifth draft, which long remained in the hands of the family
of Col. Alexander Bliss, publisher of <i>Autograph Leaves</i>, is known as the
Bliss copy. It was purchased in 1949 by Oscar B. Cintas, of Havana,
Cuba.</p>
<h3 id="c24">SOLDIERS&rsquo; NATIONAL MONUMENT.</h3>
<p>As a fitting memorial to the Union
dead who fell at Gettysburg, the Commissioners arranged for the erection
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
of a monument in the center of the semicircular plot of graves. A
design submitted by J.&nbsp;G. Batterson was accepted and the services of
Randolph Rogers, a distinguished American sculptor, were secured for
the execution of the monument. Projecting from the four angles of the
gray granite shaft are allegorical statues in white marble representing
War, History, Peace, and Plenty. Surmounting the shaft is a white
marble statue representing the Genius of Liberty. Known as the Soldiers&rsquo;
National Monument, the cornerstone was laid July 4, 1865, and the
monument dedicated July 1, 1869.</p>
<h3 id="c25">THE LINCOLN ADDRESS MEMORIAL.</h3>
<p>The &ldquo;few appropriate remarks&rdquo; of
Lincoln at Gettysburg came to be accepted with the passing of years not
only as a fine expression of the purposes for which the war was fought,
but as a masterpiece of literature. An effort to have the words of the
martyr President commemorated on this battlefield culminated with the
inclusion in the act approved February 12, 1895, which established
Gettysburg National Military Park, of a provision for the erection of
such a memorial. Pursuant to this authority, the Park Commission
erected the Lincoln Address Memorial, in January 1912, near the west
gate of the national cemetery.</p>

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small"><i>Guide Tour of the Park</i>&mdash;(See map on <a href="#Page_52">page 52</a>.)</span></h2>
<p>The self-guide tour of the park begins on McPherson Ridge, a mile west
of Gettysburg. Upon arrival in Gettysburg, the visitor should first locate
Center Square, then drive a mile westward on U.&nbsp;S. No. 30 to the statues
of Generals Reynolds and Buford.</p>
<h3>STOP 1. MCPHERSON RIDGE.</h3>
<p>(Please face westward, with the statue of Reynolds on your right.)</p>
<p>The Battle of Gettysburg began on this ridge at 8 a.&nbsp;m., July 1, 1863.
The Confederate Army, approaching along the Chambersburg Pike,
formed line of battle on the ridge one-half mile westward where you
see the brick house (Herr Tavern). They first attacked the Union cavalry
on this ridge, then infantry on the ridge 200 yards to your rear. In the
afternoon, the Confederates renewed their drive from the west along the
Pike and also struck the Union right flank (Oak Hill, No. 2 on Tour
Map). The Union forces finally gave way, retreating first to the Seminary
buildings and then to Cemetery Hill south of Gettysburg.</p>
<p>General Reynolds, commanding a Union corps, was killed in the
woods a quarter of a mile southeast of this point. Buford, whose statue
is just in front of you, commanded the Union cavalry on this ridge. The
marked gun at the base of the Buford statue fired the first cannon shot
at Gettysburg. Oak Ridge lies one-half mile back of you, and the same
wooded ridge extending south of the Chambersburg Pike is Seminary
Ridge.</p>
<p>General Lee, the Confederate commander, used the valley beyond the
South Mountains (to the west) as an avenue of approach into Pennsylvania.</p>
<h3>STOP 2. OAK HILL.</h3>
<p>(Please face southward with the Peace Memorial to
your rear.)</p>
<p>The Battle of Gettysburg, which began at 8 a.&nbsp;m., on the two ridges
a mile south of here, halted at noon, and the Confederates withdrew. At
1 o&rsquo;clock, a strong Confederate force arrived from the north on this hill
and fired into the flank of the Union men on the ridges to the south.
Faced with this powerful fire and with renewed attack from the west,
part of the Union forces were shifted to Oak Ridge (see monuments on
the ridge to your left) to meet the attack from this direction. Union
troops on the plain east of this ridge were soon forced by another strong
Confederate charge to retreat headlong through the streets of Gettysburg,
opening the Union line on Oak Ridge to flank and rear attack.
By mid-afternoon, the Union position on Oak Ridge was abandoned,
and the Confederates pursued the retreating Union troops through
Gettysburg, halting in the western part of the town.</p>
<p>The gap in the South Mountains to your right is Cashtown Pass
where Lee&rsquo;s army crossed the range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3>STOP 3. OAK RIDGE.</h3>
<p>(Please face eastward toward the monuments on
the plain.)</p>
<p>When Rodes&rsquo; Confederate troops reached Oak Hill at 1 o&rsquo;clock,
Union troops on McPherson Ridge, as well as reserves, were shifted
hurriedly to this ground. The Union troops, posted back of the stone
wall, faced the Confederate charge from the west and north. Tenaciously
holding this ground through repeated Confederate attacks, the Union
men were finally forced to give way. Howard&rsquo;s Union corps had arrived
earlier in the plain north of Gettysburg (see monuments to the east)
but his command was soon shattered by a Confederate force arriving
from the northeast on the Harrisburg Road (near flagpole, a mile eastward).
As the Union troops north of Gettysburg retreated, the men on
this ridge became isolated and withdrew to Cemetery Hill, south of the
town.</p>
<p>The large white building on this side of Gettysburg is &ldquo;Old Dorm&rdquo;
at Gettysburg College, used as a hospital during the battle. Beyond the
town is Culp&rsquo;s Hill (see the observation tower), and in the right background
is Cemetery Hill.</p>
<h3>STOP 4. SEMINARY RIDGE.</h3>
<p>(North Carolina Monument.)</p>
<p>General Lee had failed to achieve any definite gains July 2 against the
Union left flank at Little Round Top and the Peach Orchard, or the
right flank at Spangler&rsquo;s Spring and Culp&rsquo;s Hill. He therefore marshaled
his forces on the forenoon of July 3 for a final thrust against the center
of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. For nearly 2 hours, 138 Confederate
guns on this ridge directed a heavy fire at the Union positions.
Lee then sent 15,000 men across the open ground with the Copse of
Trees (No. 8 on the Tour Map) as their objective. Spearheaded by
Pickett&rsquo;s division, and therefore known as Pickett&rsquo;s Charge, this famous
attack failed to break the strong Union positions at the stone wall. The
advance marked the end of battle and the failure has been called the
High Water Mark of the Confederacy. Lee gave up hope of further
attack on this field, and on the following day began his retreat toward
the Potomac and Virginia.</p>
<p>The wooded knoll to the east is Cemetery Hill (No. 10 on the Tour
Map). Cemetery Ridge extends southward to Little Round Top (No. 7
on the Tour Map), the small hill partially cleared of trees at the left of
Big Round Top. The Copse of Trees and The Angle (No. 8 on the Tour
Map) are on the crest of the Cemetery Ridge where the flagpole appears.</p>
<h3>STOP 5. WARFIELD RIDGE.</h3>
<p>The Union General Sickles, at noon July 2, began moving his troops
forward from Cemetery Ridge and Little Round Top to Devil&rsquo;s Den
Ridge and the Peach Orchard. Longstreet&rsquo;s Confederate corps was
already marching from the Chambersburg Road to extend the line southward
across the Emmitsburg Road. At 3:30 p.&nbsp;m., as Sickles&rsquo; men were
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
taking position at the Peach Orchard and the Emmitsburg Road, a half-mile
north of here, Longstreet brought his army into position on this
ridge. A brisk artillery exchange opened. Longstreet directed his infantry
attack first at Little Round Top (the partially cleared hill to your right)
and then along the whole Union line northward to the Peach Orchard
and the Emmitsburg Road. Four hours later, as darkness gathered, the
Union line had been shattered and forced to retreat. The Confederates
gained possession of the west slope of Big Round Top, Devil&rsquo;s Den, and
the high ground in the vicinity of the Peach Orchard.</p>
<h3>STOP 6. DEVIL&rsquo;S DEN.</h3>
<p>When General Sickles moved his corps forward to the Peach Orchard
and the Emmitsburg Road at 3 p.&nbsp;m., his left flank was here at Devil&rsquo;s
Den. Longstreet&rsquo;s Confederate brigades soon came charging from the
west. Striking the entire Union line, the base of Little Round Top and
this area quickly became a shambles. After hours of desperate struggle,
the Union line had been broken and the remnants forced to the rear. The
Confederates were now in possession of the west slope of Big Round
Top, Devil&rsquo;s Den, the Wheatfield, and the Peach Orchard. Sharpshooters,
using the large boulders as defense positions, fired at Union
men on the crest of Little Round Top, 700 yards distant. A typical
sharpshooter&rsquo;s barricade may still be seen at the top of Devil&rsquo;s Den.</p>
<h3>STOP 7. LITTLE ROUND TOP.</h3>
<p>As Sickles completed the forward movement from Little Round Top
and the area northward, his new line extended from the Peach Orchard
southeastward through the Wheatfield to Devil&rsquo;s Den (see boulders
below). Longstreet&rsquo;s attack on Little Round Top developed from the
ridge a mile westward. His brigades successively struck the entire Union
line from Devil&rsquo;s Den to the Emmitsburg Road. The Confederates in
a 4-hour fight broke the entire Union line, and the remnants of Sickles&rsquo;
corps were forced to retreat to the rear of the Round Tops. The Confederates
gained possession of the west slope of Big Round Top, Devil&rsquo;s
Den, the Wheatfield (the open ground surrounded by woods), and the
Peach Orchard (near the white buildings on the ridge). The quick action
of General Warren (see bronze figure to the north) in bringing
troops to Little Round Top saved the hill for the Union. The stone
breastworks on the slope of the hill were constructed during the night
of July 2 as a defense measure against further attack. Big Round Top, a
quarter of a mile southward, was heavily wooded at the time of the
battle and could not be used to advantage by either artillery or infantry.</p>
<h3>STOP 8. CEMETERY RIDGE (THE ANGLE).</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of July 2, General Lee had tried to turn the left flank
of the Union line at Little Round Top and the Peach Orchard, and the
right flank at Culp&rsquo;s Hill and Spangler&rsquo;s Spring. Meeting with only
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
partial success in these attempts, he then planned to strike the center.
First he massed his artillery on Seminary Ridge and across the fields.
Many batteries were hardly more than 800 yards west of here. Beginning
at 1 o&rsquo;clock they engaged in an artillery duel of nearly 2 hours with the
powerful Union batteries on this ridge. Then 15,000 men, in a battle line
a mile in length, and spearheaded by Pickett&rsquo;s division, started from the
Confederate lines across the open fields, with the Copse of Trees as their
guide. When they reached the Emmitsburg Road 300 yards away, the
men charged. Canister from Union artillery and concentrated infantry
fire from the Union men at the stone walls soon cut wide gaps in the
Confederate line. They reached the wall, and a small band of men crossed,
but the tide had turned. In Lee&rsquo;s final great effort, he had lost nearly
10,000 of his men. The remnants gave way and soon were in full retreat
to the Confederate lines. The counterattack, which Lee feared, never
developed.</p>
<p>The Copse of Trees is at your left, surrounded by the iron fence. The
position of Cushing&rsquo;s battery of United States artillery, which held the
position at The Angle, is marked by four guns. The statue of General
Meade stands to the right and rear.</p>
<h3>STOP 9. MEADE&rsquo;S HEADQUARTERS.</h3>
<p>Gen. George G. Meade, commanding the Union Army, arrived on the
field near midnight, July 1. He used the Leister house as his headquarters.</p>
<p>On the night of July 2, General Meade called a council of his corps
commanders in this house to determine whether they should hold the
positions then established. The commanders advised him to hold the
existing lines. Meade, agreeing with their advice and expecting the next
attack on the center of his line, began the concentration of artillery and
infantry strength in this area.</p>
<p>The Leister house and barn were badly damaged by the artillery fire
which preceded Pickett&rsquo;s Charge.</p>
<h3>STOP 10. NATIONAL CEMETERY.</h3>
<p>Soon after the battle, Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, commissioned
Attorney David Wills, of Gettysburg, to purchase this ground as a
cemetery for the Union dead. While reburials from the temporary graves
on the battlefield were in progress, a committee arranged for a formal
dedication on November 19, 1863. President Lincoln delivered his
famous Gettysburg Address on that occasion. The National Monument,
commemorating the Union soldiers who fell at Gettysburg, was dedicated,
in 1869, on the site where Lincoln spoke. A memorial to the
address was erected, in 1912, near the west gate of the cemetery.</p>
<h3>STOP 11. CYCLORAMA OF PICKETT&rsquo;S CHARGE.</h3>
<p>The Cyclorama of Pickett&rsquo;s Charge is regarded as a masterpiece of art.
It offers an unsurpassed picture of the wartime appearance of the field,
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
the manner of fighting, and of equipment employed. This magnificent
painting, measuring 370 feet in circumference and 30 feet in height, was
acquired by the National Park Service in 1942. The French artist, Paul
Philippoteaux, completed the painting in 1884. It was brought to Gettysburg
in 1913 when it was first mounted and exhibited in connection with
the observance of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.</p>
<h3>STOP 12. EAST CEMETERY HILL.</h3>
<p>Early&rsquo;s Confederates assaulted Union positions here at dusk on July 2,
in coordination with an attack on Culp&rsquo;s Hill (to your right). Rodes&rsquo;
men failed to charge from the west at the same time. Early&rsquo;s troops took
possession of the hill and many of the guns, but in the absence of support
from Rodes they were driven back. The desperate hand-to-hand
fighting lasted long after dark.</p>
<p>Culp&rsquo;s Hill is one-quarter mile eastward (see the observation tower)
and Spangler&rsquo;s Spring a few hundred yards beyond. Oak Ridge, a landmark
of the first day&rsquo;s battle, appears northwest of the town.</p>
<h3>STOP 13. CULP&rsquo;S HILL.</h3>
<p>A Confederate attack was directed against this hill on July 2 in conjunction
with the assault on East Cemetery Hill. Because of the steep
incline and the strength of the Union positions here at the crest, the
Confederate force shifted southward across Rock Creek for a flank attack.
Most of the Union troops had been ordered earlier to the defense of the
Wheatfield and Peach Orchard. The Confederates, meeting with little
resistance, took possession of the Union earthworks on the south slope
of this hill. Before a Confederate attack developed against this position
on the following morning, the Union force had returned. After fighting
throughout the forenoon of July 3, they forced the Confederates out of
the Union defense works. The Union brigade commanded by General
Greene retained this position throughout the battle of July 2 and 3.</p>
<h3>STOP 14. SPANGLER&rsquo;S SPRING.</h3>
<p>Failing to take possession of Culp&rsquo;s Hill on the evening of July 2,
Johnson&rsquo;s Confederate force shifted southward across Rock Creek and
attacked the Union position on the hill north of this spring. The defense
works here had been vacated an hour earlier when most of the troops
were called to help defend the Union line in the Wheatfield and Peach
Orchard. The Confederates then took possession of the Union works.
The Union forces, having returned during the night, opened fire at dawn
on July 3 with artillery and infantry. Confederate troops who were
posted in the Union works and in rear of the stone wall on the hill to
the north made a determined stand. After hard fighting, which ended
only at noon, the Union force succeeded in driving the Confederates out
of these works and eastward beyond striking range.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small"><i>The Park</i></span></h2>
<p>In 1895, the battlefield was established by act of Congress as Gettysburg
National Military Park. In that year, the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial
Association, which had been founded April 30, 1864, for the purpose
of commemorating &ldquo;the great deeds of valor, endurance, and noble self-sacrifice,
and to perpetuate the memory of the heroes, and the signal
events which render these battlegrounds illustrious,&rdquo; transferred its holdings
of 600 acres of land, 17 miles of avenues, and 320 monuments and
markers to the Federal Government. Under the jurisdiction of the War
Department until 1933, the park was transferred in that year to the
Department of the Interior to be administered by the National Park
Service. Today, the park consists of 2,554.82 acres of land and 26 miles of
paved roads.</p>
<p>The fields over which the battles were fought cover about 16,000 acres
and include the town of Gettysburg. A total of 2,390 monuments,
tablets, and markers have been erected over the years to indicate the
positions where infantry, artillery, and cavalry units fought. Of the 354
Union and 272 Confederate cannon engaged or held in reserve during
the battle, 233 Federal and 182 Confederate are located on the field in
the approximate position of the batteries during the battle.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small"><i>Anniversary Reunions of the Civil War Veterans</i></span></h2>
<p>The great interest of veterans and the public alike in the Gettysburg
battlefield has been reflected over the years in three outstanding anniversary
celebrations. Dominant in the observance of the 25th anniversary
in 1888 were the veterans themselves, who returned to encamp on
familiar ground. It was on this occasion that a large number of regimental
monuments, erected by survivors of regiments or by States, were
dedicated. Again, in 1913, on the 50th anniversary, even though the
ranks were gradually thinning, the reunion brought thousands of veterans
back to the battlefield. Perhaps the most impressive tribute to the surviving
veterans occurred July 1-4, 1938, on the occasion of the observance
of the 75th anniversary of the battle and the last reunion of the men who
wore the blue and the gray. Although 94 years was the average age of
those attending, 1,845 veterans, out of a total of about 8,000 then living,
returned for the encampment. It was on this occasion that the Eternal
Light Peace Memorial was dedicated.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small"><i>How to Reach the Park</i></span></h2>
<p>Gettysburg National Military Park and National Cemetery are accessible
by highway over U.&nbsp;S. No. 30 from the east and west, U.&nbsp;S. No. 15 from
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
the north and south; U.&nbsp;S. No. 140 from Baltimore, Md.; State No. 34
from Carlisle, Pa.; and State No. 116 from Hagerstown, Md., and Hanover,
Pa. Greyhound Bus Lines operate over U.&nbsp;S. Nos. 30 and 140; the
Blue Ridge Lines over U.&nbsp;S. No. 15 from the south; and the Gettysburg-Harrisburg
Bus Line over U.&nbsp;S. No. 15 from Harrisburg.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small"><i>Administration</i></span></h2>
<p>Gettysburg National Military Park is administered by the National
Park Service of the United States Department of the Interior. Communications
should be addressed to the Superintendent, Gettysburg
National Military Park, Gettysburg, Pa.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small"><i>Related Areas</i></span></h2>
<p>Significant parts of most of the major battlefields of the Civil War have
been set aside under the control of the Federal Government to be administered
as national military areas by the National Park Service. Among
the areas in this group are: Antietam National Battlefield Site, Md.;
Manassas National Battlefield Park, Va.; Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania
County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park (includes
Chancellorsville, The Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, and
Fredericksburg battlefields), Va.; Petersburg National Military Park, Va.;
Richmond National Battlefield Park, Va.; Appomattox Court House
National Historical Park, Va.; Shiloh National Military Park, Tenn;
Fort Donelson National Military Park, Tenn.; Stones River National
Military Park, Tenn.; Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military
Park, Tenn.-Ga.; Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park, Ga.;
Fort Sumter National Monument, S.&nbsp;C.; Vicksburg National Military
Park, Miss.; and Fort Pulaski National Monument, Ga.</p>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small"><i>Visitor Facilities</i></span></h2>
<p>Information and free literature concerning the park may be obtained at
the National Park Service museum in the Post Office building, at the
national cemetery office, and at the park entrance stations. The services
of park historians are available free for explanation of the battle, talks
over a relief model of the battlefield in the museum, and for field tours
with educational groups. A historian is stationed at Little Round Top
during the summer season.</p>
<p>Field exhibits, consisting of a map of the battlefield and wartime
photographs, are located at important points in the park for the use and
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
interest of the public. With the exception of December, January, and
February, the cyclorama is open weekdays from 10 a.&nbsp;m. to 12 noon and
1 p.&nbsp;m. to 5 p.&nbsp;m. and on Sundays 10 a.&nbsp;m. to 12 noon and 1 p.&nbsp;m. to
6 p.&nbsp;m. The admission fee is 25 cents for persons 12 years of age and
over. School groups, 12 to 18 years of age, and children under 12 years
of age are admitted free. Battlefield guides, licensed by the National
Park Service, operate under the supervision of the park superintendent.
A complete tour of the park, which covers the battleground of July 1,
north and west of Gettysburg, and of July 2 and 3, south of the town,
requires approximately 2 hours, and the guide fee is $4. A special tour,
covering the main points of interest and requiring about 1 hour, is available
at a fee of $3. The guide fee for a short bus tour is $5; for a long
bus tour $6.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
